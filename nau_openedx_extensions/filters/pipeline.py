    """
    Stop enrollment process raising PreventEnrollment exception if the user has an email
    with a domain that is not in those allowed by a course in DomainsAllowedPerCourse.

    It also allows instructor to override the filter. The user can enroll even if its email
    domain doesn't be one of the allowed if the instructor has added its email as one of the
    Course Enrolment Allowed. A race condition can raise an error, if the user account already
    exist and is inactive, in this case the instructor couldn't add manualy the custom user to
    the course. If this happens, the user needs to activate their account before the instructor
    could create the enrollment.

    Example usage:
    Add the following configurations to your configuration file:
        "OPEN_EDX_FILTERS_CONFIG": {
            "org.openedx.learning.course.enrollment.started.v1": {
